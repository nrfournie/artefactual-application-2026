# My Customer Success Philosophy

Customer Success is about translating complexity into confidence—and recognizing that behind every technical question is a human being navigating uncertainty.

At Libro Credit Union, I learned that trust is earned through honesty and consistency, especially when delivering difficult news. Whether calling about missed payments or investigating fraud, I addressed **the human first**: acknowledged their concern, explained clearly, and guided them toward solutions without judgment.

For Artefactual's clients, archivists stewarding irreplaceable cultural materials, the challenge isn't just "Can this software work?" It's "Will I feel supported through this process?"

My role is to be the bridge: Eager to learn the technical side and deeply committed to the human side (patience, clarity, trust). This aligns with Artefactual's values of trustworthiness, collaboration, and sustainability.

Digital preservation is sacred work. My job is to honour that by making the complex feel manageable
