# Digital Preservation & Customer Success Portfolio

## Why This Repository Exists

Hello, Artefactual team.

I am applying for the **Digital Preservation & Access Specialist, Customer Success** role, and I wanted to demonstrate my "curious mindset" in a format your team uses every day: GitHub.

While I don't have a traditional developer background, I have been building digital preservation systems at **The Contemplative Society** using structured data, migrations, and workflow design—the skillset you need for customer onboarding and lifecycle management.

This repository contains samples of my work.

- **My Role:** Designed and executed full data audit, backup, and migration

- **Outcome:** 100% data integrity, zero files lost, reduction in contractor and hosting fees
